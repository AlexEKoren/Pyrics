#Pyric

This is a simply Python script that will crawl metrolyrics.com, ingest the lyrics, and spit out a new line for every new webpage it finds.

It was inspired by [@j6k4m8's](http://github.com/j6k4m8) post [here](blog.jordan.matelsky.com/markov/)

To use this script, make sure you have pyenchant and BeautifulSoup installed:

brew install enchant
pip install pyenchant
pip install BeautifulSoup

This might actually be a not that bad way to come up with ideas for new songs...
